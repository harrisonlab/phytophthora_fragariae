# Commands to prepare gene annotations and raw reads for submission to NCBI

This appears to be a complex procedure, following Andy's commands.
Bioprojects & Biosamples have already been created.

## Submission steps

batch submission, I have been advised there is no way to update them and the
whole submission has to be repeated.
